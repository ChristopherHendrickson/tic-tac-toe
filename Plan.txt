basic reqs:

Class objects
players: Player objects are retrieved on input from [json]? file, defaults to player 1/2 (Does not save background scores, only live scores). Create some auth for these?
	PROPERTIES 
	name: (can be retrieved later to compare scores between different players), must be unique, default 1/2
	tile: x/o
	tileRef: is a ref to an image. default x/o. generated at game init, can be adjusted to any image ref and saved in player file
	isPlayer: boolean. determines if it is an ai or player
	
	
	potential additions to save scores

	score dict: saves scores against other player names that have vsd previously
	isDefault: default players are not saved. 
	oppenents: when vs a new player object, add to this. Keep tack of scores here {name: (or direct ref to opponent objcet), myScore:, opponentScore:}, default is an ai opponent.
	METHODS
	pickMove (AI for, needs acces to board to choose a move)
	save: add to JSON, trigger on win event. How to update only players that have played?
		pull all player data, create all player objects, find player object by name, update that object, remkae full json file
	

NOT SURE IF I CAN WRITE TO A JSON FEIL FROM JAVASCRIPT so ignore player and score saving. Think you need node.js?

Board:
	PROPERTIES
	size: int - min/default 3
	nodes: the game squares - 0 - size^2-1
	winLines: another object - used to iterate over and check if win line contains all same player object
	METHOD
	addNodes: makes and adds nodes to nodes prop
	

Nodes:	each square in the board
	PROPERTEIS
	id: 0 - size^2-1
	contains: (empty (null)?, player objects)
	METHODS
	eventListener: listen for click event, check for contains, check for player is current player, take current player.tile, set backgrond, set contains. this is a bit strange, game flow will be partially controlled within node method

Game Funcitons.

GenerateBoard: create board object, make board grid of size n^2, add to DOM grid




checkForWin: triggered on three in a row, how to check for win? Iterate on nodes?
		iterate over boards win lines
		increment player score, update player object (check/add opponent to opponents list, will need to update both player objects in this case)




createPlayers: makes player object absed on JSON ref, or if not existing creates new.
		on game load defaults to isDefault: True,
		takes a JSON input pulled from name input if it exists.


game flow.

	init game>generateBoard, createPlayers
	click listener> all main game flow triggered by node click
		check if is players turn (how to save this. Globally? sure) //second thought this isnt actualy two player, no need to check
		if not, do nothing
		if is, check if square is available
		if not, do nothing
		if is, update node, check for win
		if not win, 
			change player turn
			update properties of node object
		if win,
			animate the line of win
			display win message
			update player score object
			display new player scores
			click to continue
			generateBoard
			
					
DOM.
	DOM needs access to board object, player objects (scores, names, images).
	
HTML
	nodes are added to a grid element, board has fixed size, nodes scale to fit. the node grid lines will need to be dynamic depeneing on size
	A nested for loop interating over rows and columns wil be able to add them to the correct location.

	



Goals for today. Fix bot for bigger grids, properly implementing memo might fix this
Add a difficulty setting, with purely a blocker. and fully random. Should be able to adjust existing algorithm for a blocker only. Partially random on blocker, equal score weightings selecting randomly in getMin and get Max index functions.
Implement a selectable 'in-a-row' win requirement for bigger games
computers can fight eachother

Idea to fix runtime issue on bigger boards. Until there is 9 empty nodes, make moves randomly, or next to the lasst move.

Implement the game and score saving
